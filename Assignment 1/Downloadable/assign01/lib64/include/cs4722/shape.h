    /**
\brief Base class of classes that represent particular geometric shapes such as
rectangular parallelepipeds or spheres

The class shape is the base class for classes representing geometric shapes.
These shapes generally have a fixed size and orientation.
The intention is that transformations will be applied to place and size
these shapes appropriately.
This is the purpose of the
[artifact](@ref artifact) class.

Subclasses will implement several methods that provide vertex data for
a shape: positions, normal vectors, texture coordinates, and tangent vectors.
Subclasses will also provide a color pattern that is useful in basic examples.
The root class `shape` has, at this point, six subclasses.

      
- [block](@ref block)
  - A unit cube centered at the origin
- [sphere](@ref sphere)
  - A unit sphere centered at the origin
- [cylinder](@ref cylinder)
  - A cylinder of height 1 and radius 1 centered at the origin with central
      axis along the y axis
- [torus](@ref torus)
  - A torus surrounding the z axis with outer radius 1
- [torus_points](@ref torus_points)
  - Just the points created by a triangulation of a torus
- [rectangle](@ref rectangle)
  - A square


## Usage

The  way the shape classes should be used is as follows:

* Create a shape with whatever parameters desired for the appropriate constructor
* Get the vertex lists needed for a particular application and put them into
    a buffer
    * This will involve setting `buffer_start` and `buffer_size` but should
         not change any other attributes
    * Once the lists have been used to initialize buffers, they can be deleted
* Do not change attributes of the `shape` after this
