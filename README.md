# computer-graphics

This is my entire assignment history for my computer graphics class. It taught me a lot about shaders, pipeline rendering, and color mixing. What it taught me most of all however, was the ability to be submerged into a new environment and start reading docs or looking at tutorials. I was not apart of the game design curriculum so I had no prior knowledge about this course until I took it. It ended up being a great experience for me to get really comfortable reading documentation.

This is a screenshot of just one of the assignments we worked on in this class. ![image](https://github.com/RonakRajniPatel/computer-graphics/assets/106451063/47078cfa-1288-459a-a93a-b42f93e59a66).
